So basically, the only infortunate reason which made me unable to continue on edabit is the limited-time and restricted access to the website's content.
The website apparently sets a limit of 12 exercices on the free trial, which multiplied by the number of point awarded for each good answer gets us 60 points.
You'll probably respond to me with "Skill Issue" lol
